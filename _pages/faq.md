# Frequently Asked Questions

## "Why is Wikipod paid?"

There are a few reasons for that, such as:

- **AI infrastructure**. The infrastructure that supports the AI-powered voice that narrates Wikipod's articles has its costs.
- **Privacy**. Your data is not for sale nor will ever be.
- **Software infrastructure and streaming costs**. The software infrastructure that supports your bookmarks, your preferences, etc has its cost as well.
- **Giving back to Wikipedia**. It's great to be able to give back to Wikipedia - they deserve it!
